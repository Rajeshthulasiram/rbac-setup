Namespace → Roles → RoleBindings → Sample Pod — all in one go.

Yes, Rajesh — absolutely! 🚀
What you’ve done here definitely qualifies as hands-on project experience and is valuable enough to include in your CV.

✅ Why It’s Resume-Worthy
You’ve:

Designed and implemented RBAC policies using Roles and RoleBindings

Created a namespace-isolated security model

Managed multi-user access based on least-privilege principle

Deployed and tested workloads (e.g., nginx Pod)

Used imperative and declarative Kubernetes techniques

That’s exactly the kind of practical, production-like experience hiring managers look for.

📝 How to Add It to Your Resume (Project Example)
🧾 Project: Kubernetes RBAC Access Control for Multi-User Namespace
Description:
Designed and implemented namespace-level Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes to manage fine-grained permissions for multiple users (john, dave, admin) using Roles and RoleBindings. Deployed a sample NGINX pod for access validation.

Key Tasks:

Created read, read-write, and admin Roles with scoped access

Applied RoleBindings for individual user access

Built all components via both YAML and imperative kubectl commands

Tested access restrictions per user role

Tools: Kubernetes, kubectl, RBAC, YAML



🎯 STAR Format (for Interview Questions)
S – Situation:
As part of a Kubernetes learning and infrastructure hardening initiative, I needed to simulate a real-world, secure multi-user access environment within a Kubernetes cluster.

T – Task:
My goal was to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within a namespace (rajesh-app) and restrict users like john, dave, and admin based on least privilege principles. I also had to validate their access using test Pods.

A – Action:

Created a dedicated namespace using kubectl create namespace

Designed and applied Roles (read-role, read-write-role, and admin-role) using both imperative and YAML-based definitions

Configured RoleBindings to associate specific users to roles

Deployed a test NGINX pod and verified access levels for each user

Documented all RBAC policies, commands, and YAMLs for reproducibility

R – Result:

Achieved complete access segregation and validated correct permissions per user

Gained hands-on production-like experience in Kubernetes RBAC

Created a reusable setup useful for teams or interview demonstration
